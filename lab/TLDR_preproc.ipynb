      "TRANSCRIPT_OF_VIDEO_RESULT_2: So, there's this girl that I've been working with for almost 4 years now and we've become pretty good friends in that time. I've always thought she was pretty cute, and occasionally have wondered about trying to ask her out on a date, but never have. In the time that we have been friends, I have dated two girls, with the second relationship ending this June. The day she broke up with me (which btw was through a text. which fucking sucked 'cause not only her, but the girl before did this to me as well) I went to sit on break with another very good friend of mine that I also happen to work with. Coincidentally, this friend happened to be working with the girl I like, and apparently before I came in to sit on break with him, he said that she was telling him that she wished I wasn't dating the other girl, and that whenever she tries talking to other guys, she always compares them to me and can't seem to like them, and that if I asked her out, she'd say yes. I've been scared to try and talk to her, because I'm leaving for school that is a few hours away from her school, which I realize isn't THAT far away, but still, I don't know if I want a long distance relationship, especially at the beginning of one. I guess I've kind of convinced myself that I don't like her, but a couple days ago I had an epiphany that I really do like her, a lot, and I think she's absolutely perfect for me. The only thing is, is that I leave for school this coming Friday. I don't know if I should express my feelings to her or not.\n",

      "TRANSCRIPT_OF_VIDEO_RESULT_3: Hey guys. I posted about a week ago about my girlfriend (18) and I (17) and our relationship struggles while I make a decision about which college I go to. Since then, (she broke up with me for a day while I visited one of my choices) we have worked things out and are back together.\n",

      "Now, however, she says that if we're not at the same college next year, she's just going to leave me for good. I really want to go to the one that I have picked out, and she says there's no way she's changing her school either. She's been very controlling this whole year we've been together, but I love her more than my own life and everything else in the planet.\n",

      "This is where I come into a problem, as recently I've been trying to picture a life without her. All of the stuff (my room has pictures of us all over it) would be terrible to try and deal with, and I know I'd probably miss her and want her back some time very soon, but I just don't know what to do.

      "TRANSCRIPT_OF_VIDEO_RESULT_4: Hey Reddit,\n",
      "So ever since November 11, 2010, I have been dating the girl of my dreams. She is amazing Reddit. She likes all the same things as I do, she enjoys the same movies, books, music, and food as I do. I know you may think, \"Well this just sounds like what a girlfriend is supposed to be.\" but Reddit, it's more, I know it is. We started dating halfway through Senior year of high school and even got through a year of being 4 hours away. (Different Universities.) Now the problem that has presented itself just recently is that her mother has decided to speak out against me, saying I'm not right for her daughter and that I won't ever be good enough for her. Reddit, I would give anything for this girl, I would give my very life for her. I have given her everything she has wanted of me, no questions asked. She tells me that, the main problem is that the emotional stress of being so far away during school is catching up to her, and that she wants to have some time to be able to do things on her own and not be so dependent on everyone. i.e her parents and I. But when she says, \"time\" she means, a whole semester of no communication whatsoever, no texting, calling, or visits. She tells me that hopefully by the end of this, that she is able to do stuff on her own and the we can still be together if we feel it' still right. But Reddit, going three months without the thing I love most in the world is going to be impossible. It's been 3 days and I have cried all the tears I have. What is it I should do? I just need some sound advice from others who have a clear view of the situation and not just friends saying, \"It'll be fine dude.\" or \"Forget her man.\" Are they right? Should I just move on? Or should I stick around to wait for something that has made me the happiest man on the planet for the past two years?\n",

      "So on to the task before me: I'm pretty sure I found \"the\" one, or at least a one, that I am crazy over. She's 18 and we're good friends. We have a lot of similar interests with the biggest one being music.\n",
